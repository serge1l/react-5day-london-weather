##  Goal

Build a weather application, taking advantage of the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve 5 day weather forecast for a given location.


## Notes

 * The default location is London, GB.

 * The location can be amended through the input field in the top right corner.

 * Individual days are clickable.


## Usage

Assuming NodeJS is installed on your system, in the project folder, where the package.json file is located, run:

 * npm install (Install project dependencies)
 * npm start   (Compile and launch)
 * Access the app through your favorite browser by pasting the following URL:

 http://localhost:8080/

 or

 http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

 for "hot reloading".
